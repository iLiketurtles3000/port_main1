This was the first project utilising the sass tecnology. This project included a wider raneg of tech beyond just css, js and html. I had to use advanced css code such as translate 3d,translate and transform. I also used all that in conjunction with bootstrap tags, css grids, dynamic styling/UI properties and the powerful mixins. This includes colour settings site wide and responsiveness on multiple device sizes for a fully curated responsive experience. I used the exact settings as the guided project suggests however, the preprocessor(nodejs-sass) is deprecated and next time I will probably use dart the officially recognised solution (https://sass-lang.com/dart-sass).

I would liek to extract the code snippet of the creation of the X top right menu thing, for later use.
